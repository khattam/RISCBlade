\chapter{Milestone 1}
Oops, I forgot this is even something I was supposed to be keeping track of.
There isn't much here anyway. I forget how much I personally decided on anyway.
We, as a group, decided to have sixteen 16-bit registers with 4-bit addresses
and specific instruction classes. We were considering having one of the source
registers for arithmetic operands be reused as a destination register (like the
way x86 handles add and sub) to save space, but that only came to pass for
instructions with immediates and memory stores.
