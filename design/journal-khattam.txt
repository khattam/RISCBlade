Milestone 1 

Wrote the Euclid's algorithm and relprime [90 mins]

Wrote the entire code in assembly to give the team an idea of what instructions we would need while developing our core instrction format. 
Did this prior to the meeting so that we could directly start with the ISA.


Team Meeting 1/2/2024 [40 mins]

We decided to build a load-store based processor. 
We broke down the 16 bits into how many we wanted to allocate for registers/types etc. 
Had an indepth discussion on how we want to optimise yet limit funt and opcode to a total of 4 bits that is at most 16 different instructions

Team Meeting 1/9/2024 [2.5 hours]

Started drafting our M1. Wrote design philosophy, and reviewed all our ISA [went over bit allocation for each type and instruction].
Assigned opcodes and funct to each instruction. Reviewed machine langauge conversion.
